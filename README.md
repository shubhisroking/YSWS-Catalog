# YSWS-Catalog

**YSWS-Catalog** is a web-based directory showcasing Hack Club’s "You Ship, We Ship" (YSWS) programs. Each YSWS program rewards participants for building and shipping projects—hardware, software, art, and more—by sending them physical or digital goodies. This repository hosts the source code for the catalog, allowing anyone to explore, filter, and learn about these initiatives. If you want to add or update a program, feel free to submit a pull request!

## Features

- **Dynamic Program Listing:** All YSWS programs are defined in `script.js` for easy editing.
- **Filtering by Status:** Quickly filter programs by `All`, `Active`, `Upcoming`, or `Completed`.
- **Search Functionality:** Easily search for programs by name, description, or Slack channel to find exactly what you're looking for.
- **Program Detail Modal:** Click on a program to view detailed information in a modal window, including participation steps and additional details.
